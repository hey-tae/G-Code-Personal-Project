    <h1>BIPOLAR DISORDER</h1>
</section>

<section class="about">
    <p class="stats">Globally, 46 million people around the world have bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>Bipolar disorder is an illness that affects how a person feels, thinks and acts. It is a sickness in the brain.When people have bipolar disorder, their brain works differently from the usual way. Our brains help us to think, feel and act in certain ways. When people have bipolar disorder, they think, feel and act differently from how they do when they’re well.There is almost always two different phases with bipolar disorder — lows called depression and highs called mania. During a low phase, the person is sad and often withdrawn. This is called depression. During a high phase, the person is either way too happy or way too angry. The person is very energetic and more outgoing than usual. This is called mania. At other times, the person is his or her usual self.
</p>
<p>While the rate of bipolar disorder is the same among BIPOC as it is among other Americans, BIPOC are less likely to receive a diagnosis and, therefore, treatment for this illness.

        Research indicates that compared to white counterparts, BIPOC individuals are:
        <ul>
            <li>Less likely to have access to mental health services</li>
            <li>Less likely to seek out services</li>
            <li> Less likely to receive needed care</li>
            <li>More likely to receive poor quality of care</li>
            <li>More likely to end services prematurely</li>
        </ul> </p>
    <p>Bipolar Disorder along with most other Mental Illnesses are sorrounded by stigma and fear. One way to remove fear of what you may not know if to educate yourself on the subject. I have personally found illnesses such as depression or anxiety, even OCD to have become somewhat designer in a way. People really don't feel the same sense of shame when talking about their struggles with those becaue they are most mainstream. It is almost a quirk to be depressed these days. While other still common illnesse such as Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder still carry this major stigma, and for the most part are wildly misrepresented in mainstream in a way that deters anyone from wanting to learn more.

<p id="iconCaption">There is no cure for depression, but there are many ways to keep it under control. Stress can be seen as a trigger for quite a few different illnesss, Bipolar Disorder included. One of the ways you can help yourself stay stress free by finsing things you love that bring you joy. spending time with yourself, treating yourself, clearing your mind throgh mediation and exersice. Spend time with people that understand you and are respecftful of your boundaries. <br> One method of self care which is heavily stigiamized is therapy. But it if not one size fits all, and if you have th eopportunity it can be a useful tool for you. Another stigma I've found is with medication. Some people need medication to live healthy functional lives and theirs nothing wrong with that. Do things that take care of you for you.</p>

        "Before I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, I had a lot of questions about myself that I let stay unanswered. I had given in to negative stereotypes I heard about Mental Illness and concluded I would grow out of these intense phases of darkness I was dealing with for a majority of my life. Getting an answer to those questions provided clarity for me. It gave me the opportunity to dig deep and learn of myself without fear. It helped me advocate for myself WITH myself."
